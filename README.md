# Project Chaos: The Entropy Engine

This application is designed to dismantle decision fatigue by introducing controlled entropy into task management. 

### Current Issues:
1. **The Logic Gap**: The 'Manifest Chaos' button frequently tries to access reality beyond the array limits.
2. **The Visual Void**: The navigation bar disappears into the ether when the page content grows.
3. **Hardcoded Stagnation**: The initial task list is static; it needs to breathe.
